#Some Very Important list functions .....(Source: GeeksForGeeks)

1. emplace(position, value) :- This function is used to insert an element at the position specified.
2. emplace_back(value) :- This function adds value at end of list.
    It is different from push_back() by the fact that it directly creates
    element at position whereas push_back() first makes a temporary copy and
    copies from there. emplace_back() is faster in implementation than push_back()
    in most situations.

3. emplace_front :- This function adds value at beginning of list.
    It is different from push_front() by the fact that it directly creates
    element at position whereas push_front() first makes a temporary copy
    and copies from there. emplace_front() is faster in implementation than
    push_front() in most situations.


4. merge(list2) :- This function is used to merge list2 with list1.
    If both the lists are in sorted order, then the resulting list is also sorted.

5. remove_if(condition) :- This function removes the element from list on the basis of condition given in its argument.

6. unique() :- This function is used to delete the repeated occurrences of the number.
    List has to be sorted for this function to get executed.

7. splice(position, list2) :- This function is used to transfer elements from one list into another.

8. swap(list2) :- This function is used to swap one list element with other.
