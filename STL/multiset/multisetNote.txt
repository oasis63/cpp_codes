Multisets are important in both math and computer science. They help us keep track of elements 
in databases, and are the backbone of modern combinatorics.

One example of multisets is a listing of the prime factors of a number. 
The factors of 4 is {2,2}, and this is different than the prime factors of 2,{2}. 
The prime factors of 90, {3,3,5,2}, are different than the prime factors of 30: {3,5,2}
